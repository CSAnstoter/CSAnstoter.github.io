							Cate is a computational and theoretical chemist with a PhD in experimental physical chemistry (Durham University, 2019). 
							She holds a Christina Miller Research Fellowship at the School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh.
							Her research combines <i>ab initio</i> electronic structure methods and semi-empirical models to calculate and rationalise the structure-property-charge relationship of organic molecules and understand photon and electron driven chemical physics. 						
							<!-- Here is an image that you can customize for this page -->
							<br>
							<p>
							Cate was previously a senior PDRA in the Dessent group at the University of York (2022-2023). Prior to this she was a post-doctoral fellow in the , in the  at Temple University in Philadelphia (2020-2021).
							
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
							The conference begins on Monday noon with registration/welcome. 
							The talks will begin after breakfast on Tuesday morning. 
							The conference ends with lectures on Friday morning and departure at noon. 
							The conference is divided into sessions with lectures having a more or less common theme. The first lecturer of each session functions as chairman and discussion leader of their session. 
							The basic principle is that all participants give a talk, which limits the number of participants to about 35. All participants can show a poster. The posters are up during the whole conference.

								<b>Development of methods and applications for electron-driven chemistry</b><br>
								Electron-driven processes are ubiquitous throughout the chemistry and biology. Electron attachment to a neutral species yields negativity charged systems, anions, that are generally destabilised.
								These states are often metastable resonances (i.e. coupled to the neutral+free electron continuum) and are susceptible to autodetachment of electrons. Despite the drive to detach the extra electron and reform
								the parent neutral + electron state, these metastable resonances are known to be important drivers of diverse reactions. 
								Understanding, and ultimately controlling, the interplay of autodetachment and electron-driven chemical reactions represents an open challenge to both the theory and experimental communities, and as such 
								the fascinating world of anions remains unchartered.
								Our group is interested in modifiying existing electronic structure methods, and developing new non-Hermetian methods, that allow us to model the energetics and lifetimes of these elusive species. 
								Such methods have been recently demonstrated to model the lifetimes for the open-shell tetracene anion, in collaboration with the Garand group.
